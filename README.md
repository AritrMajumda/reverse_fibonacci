# Reverse Fibonacci Series
This is a simple Python program that generates a reverse Fibonacci series. Instead of generating the Fibonacci series in ascending order, this program generates it in descending order.

# How it works
The program takes an input n from the user and generates a reverse Fibonacci series of length n. The reverse Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. However, instead of starting with 0 and 1 like the traditional Fibonacci series, this program starts with the highest number and works its way down to 0.

# example
if the user enters 7, the program will generate the following reverse Fibonacci series:
21 13 8 5 3 2 1
# Prerequisites
Python 3.x
